# ![CoBaIR](docs/images/logo.svg)

CoBaIR is a python library for **Co**ntext **Ba**sed **I**ntention **R**ecognition. 
It provides the means to infer an intention from given context. 
An intention is a binary value e.g. `repair pipe` that can either be present or not. Only one intention can be present at a time.
Context on the otherhand can have multiple discrete instantiations e.g. `weather:sunny|cloudy|raining`.
If context values are continuous, discretizer functions can be used to create discrete values.
From the inferred intention in a HRI scenario the robot can perform corresponding actions to help the human with a specific task.

## Install 
```bash
pip install CoBaIR
```
You can install the library from your local copy after cloning this repo with pip using `pip install .` 
or install the newest experimental features from the `develop` branch with `pip install git+https://github.com/dfki-ric/CoBaIR.git@develop`

### Known Issues
On some Linux Distros there seems to be a problem with a shared library. [This Solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71010343/cannot-load-swrast-and-iris-drivers-in-fedora-35/72200748#72200748) suggests to `export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
` which works on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Graphical User Interface
![GUI](docs/images/simpleConfig.gif "A simple configuration in the GUI")

To make the configuration of a scenario easier we provide a Graphical User Interface(GUI). The GUI can be started with
```bash
python start_configurator.py
```
if you want to start the GUI with a loaded config use
```bash
python start_configurator.py -f config.yml
```

## Bayesian Approach
In the bayesian approach CoBaIR uses a two-layer Bayesian Net of the following structure.
![two-layer Bayesian Net](docs/images/2layerbayesian.svg)

## Config Format
Configs will be saved in yml files. For convenience the is a configurator which can be started with

```bash
python start_configurator.py
```

### Bayesian Approach
The configuration file for a two layer bayesian net for context based intention recognition follows the given format:

```yaml
# List of contexts. Contexts can have different discrete instantiations. 
# Number of instantiations must be larger than 1.
# For all discrete instantiations a prior probability must be given(sum for one context must be 1)
contexts:
  context 1:
    instantiation 1 : float
      .
    instantiation m_1 : float
  context n:
    instantiation 1 : float
      .
    instantiation m_n : float
# List of intentions. Intentions are always binary(either present or not)
# For every intention the context variables and their influence on the intention is given
# [very high, high, medium, low, very low, no] => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
intentions: 
  intention 1:
    context 1:
        instantiation 1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        .
        instantiation m_1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    context n:
        instantiation 1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        .
        instantiation m_n: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
  intention p:
    context 1:
        instantiation 1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        .
        instantiation m_1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    context n:
        instantiation 1: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
        .
        instantiation m_n: int # one out of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
# decision_threshold is a float value between 0 and 1 which decides 
# when an intention should be considered in inference.
# Probability must be greater than decision_threshold.
decision_threshold: float
