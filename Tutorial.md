# CoBaIR : Interpreting Human Intentions

The CoBaIR framework is designed to interpret human intentions within diverse settings, assigning probabilities to these intentions based on the contextual information provided in scenarios like the one described in `small_example.yml`.

## Specific Scenario Analysis

### 1. Context Setup:
- **Speech Commands**: Consider a person issuing the speech command "pickup".
- **Human Holding Object**: This individual is not holding any object (false).
- **Human Activity**: The person is engaged in work (working).

### 2. Decision Threshold:
- The system's decision threshold is set at 0.8. This means that for any intention to be recognized as valid, the associated probability must exceed this threshold.

### 3. Calculating Intentions:
- **Pick Up Tool Intention**:
    - The command "pickup" leads to a high influence score of 5 for the intention to "pick up tool".
    - The absence of an object in the person's hand contributes a score of 4 to this intention.
    - Being engaged in work adds a score of 3.
    - These combined factors substantially increase the likelihood of the "pick up tool" intention.
- **Hand Over Tool Intention**:
    - The "pickup" command contributes a score of 0 to this intention.
    - The fact that the person is not holding an object contributes a score of 4.
    - The work activity adds a lower score of 1.
    - Overall, this intention is less likely compared to "pick up tool" due to lesser influence from the speech command.

### 4. Outcome:
- Considering the contexts and their impact, the system deduces that the person most likely intends to "pick up tool", with a probability surpassing the 0.8 threshold.
- Consequently, the system would likely initiate actions or responses in line with facilitating tool pickup.

This scenario exemplifies the capability of the CoBaIR to interpret and act upon human intentions in a dynamic environment by evaluating various contextual elements and their impact on potential intentions.
